# iCalMerge
A small tool to combine iCalendar (.ics) files into one.  
## Find it at >> https://usrx215.github.io/iCalMerge
Reason for this tool's existence is that Thunderbird only allows to export single .ics files at a time and I had a lot of these at hand.  
Animation made with .svg files (and slightly altered) from https://fontawesome.com
